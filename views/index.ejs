            <p class="lead">
              Wenberg Transfer was founded in 1924 by Sigurd Wenberg in
              International Falls, Minnesota. Sig originally moved to the area
              in 1910 and worked at the family grocery store. He married Sarah
              Horgan of Warren, Minnesota in 1915. In 1924, Sig began his own
              business, hauling firewood and ice with a team of horses and a
              flatbed wagon. The company’s office started in Sig and Sarah’s
              home, where it remained until the Wenberg Transfer Warehouse was
              built in 1972. Sarah played an integral role in the company,
              handling orders, answering the phone, and managing payroll for the
              employees. The couple raised five children and was active in the
              Zion Lutheran Church.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              By the late 1920s, Sig had transitioned to early trucks, expanding
              operations to haul local household goods and eventually delivering
              mail from the train station, a service the company provided until
              the late 1960s.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              The 1930s saw further expansion, with Wenberg Transfer beginning
              to ship goods out of town. In the 1940s, the company gained the
              authority to operate across six states, allowing it to offer
              household moving services alongside its freight operations.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              Sarah and Sig retired from Wenberg Transfer in the late 1950’s.
              Sarah passed away in 1959 at the age of 68, and Sig died in 1962
              at 72.

            <p class="lead">
              In 1938, Sigurd’s son, John L. Wenberg, joined the family
              business. During the late 1930s and 1940s, he was contracted by
              the Biondich logging camp. With them, John spent his winters
              hauling pulpwood for the Minnesota and Ontario Paper Company and
              his summers moving household goods between the train and local
              businesses. Over time, John L. helped expand the company’s
              operations, transitioning from straight trucks to semi-trucks. In
              1941, John L. went to serve in World War II as a truck driver. He
              was stationed in New Guinea for most of his deployment. During his
              absence, Sixton Lindberg was hired as the over-the-road truck
              driver for the company, and Walt Mahle was also hired, delivering
              mail for nearly three decades. In 1945, John L. returned to
              Wenberg Transfer to work alongside his father once again.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              In 1943, while on leave from the war, John L. married Betty
              Thompson. Betty would later play a significant role in the
              company, serving as the financial secretary from 1962 to 1986.
              Throughout her tenure, she managed the company’s finances,
              supporting the growing business while raising their three
              children—Jane, John, and Candy. Betty and John L. were also active
              members of the Zion Lutheran Church, balancing their community
              involvement with their responsibilities at Wenberg Transfer.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              From 1946 to 1978, John L. and the company expertly packed and
              moved countless households from International Falls to places all
              over their six-state region, driving through all weather
              conditions for close to a million miles without any accidents.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              John L. was a respected business owner and employer, partnering
              with his son, John S., in 1972. Together, they led Wenberg
              Transfer until John L.’s retirement in 1987, marking 41 years of
              dedicated service to the company and the community.

              The 1970s and 1980s were decades of significant change for Wenberg
              Transfer. John S. Wenberg, the son of John L, officially joined
              the business in 1967. During his college breaks and summers, John
              helped with moving jobs and worked as an over-the-road driver. In
              1968, he married Pam Woods, and shortly after, they started their
              family. Over the years, their children—Jody, Jennifer, and
              Clayton—accompanied their dad on trips in the "big truck,"
              enjoying time on the road to and from Minneapolis.

              In 1972, the company built a brand-new warehouse, allowing them to
              move from the home office at 601 8th Street in International Falls
              to their current location on Highway 332. This marked a new
              chapter in the company's growth.

              Since the late 1960s, Wenberg Transfer had been an agent for Ace
              Lines, hauling loads of insulite to North Dakota and South Dakota,
              a partnership that lasted until 1982. In 1974, the company secured
              a contract to haul paper loads to Minneapolis, further expanding
              its operations. In 1977, they landed a switching contract with
              Boise Cascade, which involved spotting trailers into the Boise
              docks for various trucking companies hauling paper out of
              International Falls—a contract Wenberg Transfer still holds today.

              In 1978, after 40 years in the moving business, Wenberg Transfer
              decided to exit the household goods moving sector. Over those four
              decades, the company had been an agent for Lyon Lines, Wheaton
              Lines, and Atlas Van Lines, facilitating countless moves. This
              decision allowed the company to focus more on three core aspects
              of its business: paper hauling, trailer switching, and LTL (Less
              Than Truck Load) hauling.

              In 1984, disaster struck when an electrical fire engulfed the
              Wenberg Transfer warehouse, destroying it and its contents.
              Fortunately, there were no injuries, but the loss was substantial.
              During this difficult time, Al Shannon of Shannon's Plumbing and
              Heating kindly offered the use of one of their storage buildings
              to house Wenberg Transfer's operations while they rebuilt. The new
              warehouse was completed in 1986 and remains the maintenance and
              storage hub for the company's trucks to this day.

              Pam and John S. became sole owners of the company in 1986, upon
              the retirements of John L. and Betty Wenberg. Pam took over the
              financial responsibilities of the company, while John focused on
              managing the hauling and switching contracts. The 1990s saw
              continued growth as their son, Clayton Wenberg, joined the company
              in 1991. Clayton began accompanying John on paper hauling trips to
              Minneapolis and soon learned the trailer switching aspect of the
              business.

              Throughout the 1980s and beyond, key employees such as Gene
              Aklestad (1960s-1970s), Howard Hauge (1970s-1990s), Jim Olson
              (1970s-2000s), Ron Pautz (1980s-2000s), Roger Frank (1980s-2010s),

              maintain the company’s standard of excellence. These individuals
              were integral to Wenberg Transfer's operations, ensuring the

              The 1990s saw continued growth for the company as son, Clayton
              Wenberg, joined in 1991. Clayton accompanied John S. on
              paper-hauling trips to Minneapolis and learned the switching
              aspect of the business firsthand. In 1999, Clayton married Dena
              Budde, and together they joined John and Pam in handling the
              day-to-day operations of the company. In 2022, daughter Jody
              (Wenberg) Youso joined the company to assist Pam with payroll and
              accounts receivable. That same year, Pam retired at age 72 after
              decades of dedication. John continues to manage certain aspects of
              the business, though he occasionally mentions the possibility of
              retirement.

              Throughout the years, Pam and John have been firm believers in

              In 2012, Wenberg Transfer discontinued hauling LTL freight to
              focus solely on paper loads and the switching operation. LTL had
              been a cornerstone of the company, hauling everything from
              firewood and ice in the 1920s to liquor, Old Dutch Chips,
              appliances, boat motors, flooring, and countless other household
              goods in the 2000s. Today, the switching business remains in full
              force, alongside paper loads being hauled to the Twin Cities.
              Backhauls include cartons to wrap the paper, Cargill Salt, and
              talc from Lake Superior Warehouse in Duluth.

              Wenberg Transfer has hauled over 400,000 loads of paper and driven
              more than 24,000,000 miles. The mill they serve began as the
              Minnesota and Ontario Paper Company, then became Boise Cascade,
              and is now known as the Packaging Corporation of America. The
              company currently employs 4 OTR (Over-the-Road) drivers, 4
